# AnvilAccess
#### A library to parse and read Minecraft anvil files, at a somewhat good speed and performance

This project was created to have a rather simple and up-to-date java library to parse/read Minecraft worlds. 
It currently targets the versions 1.21 and upwards - and is also primarily tested on these. It should, though, also work with any version above 1.18, 
where some major changes with the Y-Levels got introduced.
